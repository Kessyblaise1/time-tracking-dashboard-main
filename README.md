## My process
-First, I carefully thought out the building process after lookin at the design file.
-Next, I began by creating the html structure of the page.
-Then I moved forward to create reusable css classes and styles.
-Next, I proceeded to completing the UI with static html data.
-Finally, I added all the fucntionalities with JavaScript and pulled in the displayed data from the provided JSON file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to work with JSON data and use API fetch methods.

```
I'm particularly proud of the way I handled the data toggling from daily to weekly.
```



### Continued development

I will love to continue working with APIs to further sharppen my skills and improve my fluency with how API and SERVER data works.

### Useful resources

- I had a few challenges with handle data from JSON file and displaying different data based on the time interval the user was currently viewing, although I couldn't find a completely helpful article to ease my buggle, a few stackoverflow answers gave me a clue on what to do, I combined all of them to finally come up with what I did.
